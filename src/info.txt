1. creating react app
2. changing app function
3. creting new message function and passing props from app function
4. creating const array and use of array.map
    passing parameters using object and  also single parameter
    while accessing object values use object key in your componenet
    if you want to use two componenet inside map then use nest 
    them inside div or react fragment
@@ why we use map instead of for loop 
    - because JSX requires expression and for loop doesnot return expression but map retuns expression
    - you can not assign for loop to varibale bcs for loop doesnot retuns anything
5. Event Listener
    1.camelCase
    2.like counter react doesnot know that you have changed like count because react doesnot listen to changes that you do
    3.react listen to things that you say listen to 
    4.we can make react listen change using hooks
        - Hook is function that always start with word 'use'
        - syntax  - const[state, setState] = useState(initialValue)
            useState function will return two values 1. is state and another is setState
            setState function is used to update state

6. for giving style using conditional styles
    - use const style then object { color: ternary operator}
7. conditional rendering html is removed from DOM altogether
    - its more costly as its insertion and deletion from DOm takes lot of resources as compared to 
    hiding it within DOM
8.conditional styling html componenet is there in DOM its just hidden with display block
9.why Unique Key warning and how to solve it - reconsillation
10. add color colored textbox andadding color div below textbox 
11. in form for each input box you should have use state and 
on change function call setState of that input box
12. use of Routes, Link and Navigate
13. Anything before <Routes> will not vanish on clicking routes and links
    hence Header should be included before <Routes>
14.Showing movie details on another page
    use of useNavigate
    useParams
15.use of Context to avoid props drilling
